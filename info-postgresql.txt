In local (this is for MacOS)

To know the services in brew
brew services list

brew services start postgresql
brew services stop postgresql

netstat -anp tcp | grep 5432
This command will let us know if there are something listen in 5432 (this is the postgresql port)

-----

Important
with 'brew services list' will show something like:
Name              Status  User    File
postgresql@14     started macbook ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql@14.plist

VERY IMPORTANT as user in local here is macbook ===> 
macbook will be the Username in ConnectionStrings n appsetting.json

-------
To really destroy in local ALL postgresql DBs

1 - 
brew services stop postgresql@14

2 - delete the postgres data ==> VERY CAREFUL!!!!
rm -rf /opt/homebrew/var/postgres

3 - Reinitialize it 
initdb /opt/homebrew/var/postgres
